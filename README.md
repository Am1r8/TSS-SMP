# TSS SMP

The Thornhill Secondary School SMP or TSS SMP, is a survival Minecraft server that includes your favorite locations in Thornhill, including TSS itself! We have also made a currency that you can use in the future to purchase fun things! For early images of the SMP and to learn more about the currency please head over to our website at: https://tsssmp.games/
The SMP also has a story that is [mostly an excuse for our laziness], and you can learn more about it once you join the server.
